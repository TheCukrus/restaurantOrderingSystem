Step 3: Frontend Development

Create the Homepage:

Implement the hero section with carousel/slider and CTA button.
Design and style the navigation bar.
Create the Menu Page:

Design and style the categorized list of menu items with images, names, descriptions, and prices.
Add "Add to Cart" buttons to each item card.
Implement the dropdown or tabs for filtering menu items by categories.
Create the Cart Page:

Design and style the summary of items added to the cart, including names, quantities, individual prices, and total order amount.
Implement buttons to adjust item quantities or remove items from the cart.
Add a "Checkout" button for order placement.
Create the Login/Register Page:

Design and style separate forms for logging in and registering new accounts.
Implement user authentication and social login options (optional).
Create the Order Tracking Page:

Design and style the order tracking page with a timeline-based view of order status.
Step 4: Backend Development

Set Up Express.js Server:

Install necessary dependencies like Express, Mongoose, etc.
Create the basic Express server with routes.
Define the Database Models:

Design and create Mongoose schemas for menu items, user accounts, and orders.
Implement API Endpoints:

Create API routes for menu items, user authentication, cart management, and order tracking.
Implement CRUD operations for the necessary endpoints.
Implement User Authentication:

Set up user registration and login functionality using JWT or other authentication methods.
Ensure proper authentication and authorization for protected routes.
Step 5: Database Integration

Connect the backend to MongoDB using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.
Seed the database with initial menu items or sample data for testing.
Step 6: Frontend-Backend Integration

Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the backend API from the frontend.
Implement functions to fetch and display menu items, handle cart operations, and manage user authentication.
Step 7: Testing and Debugging

Test your application's functionalities thoroughly.
Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
Step 8: Styling and Responsive Design

Apply CSS styles to your components to make the UI visually appealing.
Ensure responsive design to make the application work well on different devices.
Step 9: Error Handling and Feedback

Implement error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of errors or invalid inputs.
Step 10: Accessibility

Ensure your application follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to make it accessible to all users.
Step 11: Deployment

Deploy your backend server on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) and the frontend on static hosting (e.g., Netlify or Vercel).
Make sure your application is accessible online.
Step 12: Final Testing and Launch

Perform final testing to ensure everything works as expected in the production environment.
Launch your Restaurant Ordering System and share it with users or potential employers as part of your portfolio.
Remember that building a full-stack project like a Restaurant Ordering System can be complex, so take your time, test thoroughly, and continually improve your code and design throughout the development process. Happy coding!
